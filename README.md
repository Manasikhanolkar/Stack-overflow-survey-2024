# Stack-overflow-survey-2024
Analyzed Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 data (65K+ rows, 114 columns) to identify trends in languages, databases, IDEs, and demographics. Cleaned and validated data, and built an interactive IBM Cognos dashboard to deliver actionable technology insights.
📊 Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 – Data Analysis & Dashboard

This project analyzes the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 dataset to uncover global trends in programming languages, databases, IDEs, and developer demographics. Using real-world survey data with significant size and complexity, the project focuses on data cleaning, validation, exploratory analysis, and dashboard creation to generate actionable insights.

The dataset contains 65,000+ survey responses and 114 columns, including multi-select fields, missing values, and inconsistent entries. Extensive data preprocessing was performed to ensure data accuracy and usability, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, splitting multi-value columns, and validating data integrity prior to analysis.

Exploratory analysis was conducted to identify emerging and declining technologies across regions and experience levels. Key insights highlight the growing adoption of modern and in-demand technologies such as Go, PostgreSQL, and ASP.NET Core, along with shifts in developer tool preferences and work patterns.

An interactive multi-tab IBM Cognos dashboard was created to visualize:

Programming language, database, and IDE usage

Technology trends over time

Developer demographics and professional background

The insights derived from this project can support workforce planning, skill development strategies, and technology adoption decisions for organizations and aspiring developers.
